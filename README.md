# Manipulating-Subtitles
This application is designed to preform modifications on subtitles files. Such as add subtitle, remove subtitle, replace certain words/phrases with another, shift subtitles’ duration or even remove an entire durations’ subtitles.

This application was made to be useful, easy, and quick for subtitle modifications and edits for multiple uses. Also, it’s easy for the developing aspects as it’s easy to maintain and add new/remove functions for future needs, or even use an entirely different data structure.
